# GTEx_SmokerStatus - Brain Data

###About
Smoking a commonly known confounder for many diseases can affect gene expression and regulation in several prtions of the brain. Being closely linked to the nicotine reward pathway, excessive smoking is known to increase activity of genes that code for proteins responsible for activity of Neuronal Nicotinic Acetycholine Receptors (nAChRs). This change in gene expression is usually irreversible and allows us to understand differences in brain function over time due to smoking. These signatures remain in individuals and their smoking status can be predicted from this. Exploratory Analysis of changes in gene expression in the Brain based on transcripts per million and covariates data obtained from GTEx Portal could help us test existing literature and add information about confounding principles like smoking. The portal provides gene expression information for different sub sections of the brain. The following brain regions data is analysed :
