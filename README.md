# GTEx_SmokerStatus - Brain Data
Exploratory Analysis of changes in gene expression in the Brain and Lungs based on transcripts per million and covariates data obtained from GTEx Portal. The portal provides gene expression information for different sub sections of the brain. The following brain regions data is analysed :
1. Substantia Nigra
2. Hypothalamus
3. Hippocampus


Data sets used :
Every brain sub-region has a unique transcripts per million gene expression file and a covariates matrix associated with it. A gene regualtion matrix made using literautre review is applicable for all sub-regions

This project/ repository has two branches:
1. Analysis of Brain Data
2. Analysis of Lung Data
